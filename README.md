# Fire-Extinguish-Robot
Fire Extinguish Robot using pi or jetson Nano,it main use is to locate and extinguish the fire camera sencer and water pump 

I add CAD file i add two file one is single file of whole model and one is file with every part file and i was not able to add Raspberry Pi 5 model so it place it empty and i make this in onshape so i did not know how to get it source file

# This is a image of final 3d model our car going to look like this when it done
